# MarketShare
Simple iOS app that prints chart of market share distribution of various asset classes:
- Global stocks
- Emerging market stocks
- Frontier market stocks
- Cryptocurrencies
- Crypto ex. BTC

Stocks data is fetched from WorldBank API and crypto data from CoinMarketCap API.

Goal of this side-project was to experiment with app architecture that is heavily reliant on Operation and OperationQueue. Unfortunately information about market distribution of commodities and bonds is not as easy to get. That is the reason, these are missing.
